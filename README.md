This is the docker implementation of the first application.Both Application and MongoDB are running in seperate container.


To run the docker compose file use below syntax
 1. cd ...                       // move to the respective directory where composer file is there
 2. docker-compose up
 
 This will run the both service on port no. 8080 and 27017 respectively.
